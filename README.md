# RPi Game Camera  
**Author:** Davey Getchell  
**Course:** CS7680 â€“ Programming Embedded Systems  
**Assignment:** Final Project  
**Due Date:** 12/13/2024  

## Overview  
This project is a proof-of-concept for a motion-activated, solar-powered game camera built using a Raspberry Pi 4, PIR motion sensor, and infrared LEDs. The system is designed to capture images/videos in remote locations, with a focus on sustainable energy use and low-power operation.  

The prototype demonstrates the feasibility of building a custom wildlife camera using cost-effective, off-the-shelf components, providing a foundation for hobbyists and researchers interested in DIY motion-based camera systems.

## Features  
- Motion-triggered image & video capture using a PIR sensor  
- Solar-powered operation for extended outdoor use  
- Lightweight software design in C, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern  
- Local storage of images/videos

## Project Limitations & Future Work  
While the prototype met its primary objectives, several areas for improvement were identified:  

- **Enhanced IR LED array** to improve nighttime visibility  
- **Light level measurements** for optimized brightness control  
- **Power consumption testing** to evaluate battery and solar efficiency  
- **Wireless media transfer** using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for easier file retrieval  
- **Weatherproof casing** to protect against outdoor conditions
